        <p class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</p>
        <p>
            “EYouth Learning” mission is helping youth to unlock a better future through learning. 
            We enable anyone in MENA region to create and share educational content (instructors) and 
            to access that educational content to learn (students). We consider our marketplace model the best 
            way to offer valuable educational content in Arabic language to our users. We need rules to keep our 
            platform and services safe for you, us, and our student and instructor community. These Terms apply to all
            your activities on EYouth Learning website.
        </p>
        <p> 
            If you publish a course on the EYouth Learning platform, you must also agree to the Instructor Terms. 
            We also provide details regarding our processing of personal data of our students and instructors in 
            our Privacy Policy. If you are using EYouth Learning as part of your employer’s EYouth Business learning 
            and development program, you can consult our EYouth Business Privacy Statement.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">1. Accounts</p>
        <p>
            You need an account for most activities on our platform. Keep your password somewhere safe, because you’re responsible for all activity associated with your account. If you suspect someone else is using your account, let us know by contacting our Support Team. You must have reached the age of consent for online services in your country to use EYouth Learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need an account for most activities on our platform, including to purchase and access content or to submit content for publication. When setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account. If you contact us to request access to an account, we will not grant you such access unless you can provide us with the information that we need to prove you are the owner of that account. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be closed.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may not share your account login credentials with anyone else. You are responsible for what happens with your account and EYouth Learning will not intervene in disputes between students or instructors who have shared account login credentials. You must notify us immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission (or if you suspect any other breach of security) by contacting our Support Team. We may request some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of your account. Students and instructors must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on EYouth Learning and use the Services.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">2. Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access</p>
        <p>
            When you enroll in a course or other content, you get a license from us to view it via the EYouth Learning Services and no other use. Don’t try to transfer or resell content in any way. We generally grant you a lifetime access license, except when we must disable the content because of legal or policy reasons or for enrollments via Subscription Plans.        </p>
        <p>
            Under our Instructor Terms, when instructors publish content on EYouth Learning, they grant EYouth Learning a license to offer a license to the content to students. This means that we have the right to sublicense the content to enrolled students. As a student, when you enroll in a course or other content, whether it’s free or paid content, you are getting a license from EYouth Learning to view the content via the EYouth Learning platform and Services, and EYouth Learning is the licensor of record. Content is licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the content in any manner (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the content and sharing it on torrent sites). </p>
        <p>
            In legal, more complete terms, EYouth Learning grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non-commercial, educational purposes through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions associated with the particular content or feature of our Services. All other uses are expressly prohibited. You may not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any content unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written agreement signed by a EYouth Learning authorized representative. This also applies to content you can access via any of our APIs.        </p>
        <p>
            We generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they enroll in a course or other content. However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use any content at any point in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to the content due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course or other content you enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if we determine it violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines. This lifetime access license does not apply to enrollments via Subscription Plans or to add-on features and services associated with the course or other content you enroll in. For example, instructors may decide at any time to no longer provide teaching assistance or Q&A services in association with the content. To be clear, the lifetime access is to the course content but not to the instructor.        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">3. Payments, Credits, and Refunds        </p>
        <p>
            When you make a payment, you agree to use a valid payment method.        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">3.1 Pricing</p>
        <p>
            The prices of content on EYouth Learning are determined based on the terms of the Instructor Terms and our Promotions Policy. In some instances, the price of content offered on EYouth Learning website may not be exactly the same as the price offered on another programs and applications.        </p>
        <p>
            We occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during which certain content is available at discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to the content will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the content (at checkout). Any price offered for particular content may also be different when you are logged into your account from the price available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, because some of our promotions are available only to new users.        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a student located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities. Depending on your location, the price you see may include such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout.        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">3.2 Payments        </p>
        <p>
            You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you authorize us to charge your debit or credit card or process other means of payment (direct debit, or mobile wallets) for those fees. EYouth Learning works with payment service providers to offer you the most convenient payment methods in your country and to keep your payment information secure. We may update your payment methods using information provided by our payment service providers. Check out our Privacy Policy for more details.        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">3.3 Refunds and Refund Credits</p>
        <p>
            If the content you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request, within 30 days of your purchase of the content, that EYouth Learning apply a refund to your account. This refund option does not apply to Subscription Plan purchases, which are covered in Section 8.4 below. We reserve the right to apply your refund as a refund credit or a refund to your original payment method, at our discretion, depending on capabilities of our payment service providers, the platform from which you purchased your content and other factors. No refund is due to you if you request it after the 30-day guarantee time limit has passed. However, if the content you previously purchased is disabled for legal or policy reasons, you are entitled to a refund beyond this 30-day limit. EYouth Learning also reserves the right to refund students beyond the 30-day limit in cases of suspected or confirmed account fraud.        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">3.4 Gift and Promotional Codes</p>
        <p >EYouth Learning or our partners may offer gift and promotional codes to students. Certain codes may be redeemed for gift or promotional credits applied to your EYouth Learning account, which then may be used to purchase eligible content on our platform, subject to the terms included with your codes. Other codes may be directly redeemable for specific content.        </p>
        <p>
            These codes and credits, as well as any promotional value linked to them, may expire if not used within the period specified in your EYouth Learning account. Gift and promotional codes offered by EYouth Learning may not be refunded for cash, unless otherwise specified in the terms included with your codes or as required by applicable law. Gift and promotional codes offered by a partner are subject to that partner’s refund policies. If you have multiple saved credit amounts, EYouth Learning may determine which of your credits to apply to your purchase. Check out our Support Page and any terms included with your codes for more details.        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">4. Content and Behavior Rules        </p>
        <p>
            You can only use EYouth Learning for lawful purposes. You’re responsible for all the content that you post on our platform. You should keep the reviews, questions, posts, courses and other content you upload in line with our Trust & Safety Guidelines and the law, and respect the intellectual property rights of others. We can ban your account for repeated or major offenses. If you think someone is infringing your copyright on our platform, let us know.        </p>
        <p>
            You may not access or use the Services or create an account for unlawful purposes. Your use of the Services and behavior on our platform must comply with applicable local or national laws or regulations of your country. You are solely responsible for the knowledge of and compliance with such laws and regulations that are applicable to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a student, the Services enable you to ask questions to the instructors of courses or other content you are enrolled in, and to post reviews of content. For certain content, the instructor may invite you to submit content as “homework” or tests. Don’t post or submit anything that is not yours.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are an instructor, you can submit content for publication on the platform and you can also communicate with the students who have enrolled in your courses or other content. In both cases, you must abide by the law and respect the rights of others: you cannot post any course, question, answer, review or other content that violates applicable local or national laws or regulations of your country. You are solely responsible for any courses, content, and actions you post or take via the platform and Services and their consequences. Make sure you understand all the copyright restrictions set forth in the Instructor Terms before you submit any content for publication on EYouth Learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we are put on notice that your course or content violates the law or the rights of others (for example, if it is established that it violates intellectual property or image rights of others, or is about an illegal activity), if we discover that your content or behavior violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines, or if we believe your content or behavior is unlawful, inappropriate, or objectionable (for example if you impersonate someone else), we may remove your content from our platform. EYouth Learning complies with copyright laws. Check out our Intellectual Property Policy for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
            EYouth Learning has discretion in enforcing these Terms and our Trust & Safety Guidelines. We may restrict or terminate your permission to use our platform and Services or ban your account at any time, with or without notice, for any or no reason, including for any violation of these Terms, if you fail to pay any fees when due, for fraudulent chargeback requests, upon the request of law enforcement or government agencies, for extended periods of inactivity, for unexpected technical issues or problems, if we suspect that you engage in fraudulent or illegal activities, or for any other reason in our sole discretion. Upon any such termination we may delete your account and content, and we may prevent you from further access to the platforms and use of our Services. Your content may still be available on the platforms even if your account is terminated or suspended. You agree that we will have no liability to you or any third party for termination of your account, removal of your content, or blocking of your access to our platforms and services.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a user has published content that infringes your copyright or trademark rights, please let us know. Our Instructor Terms require our instructors to follow the law and respect the intellectual property rights of others. For more details on how to file a copyright or trademark infringement claim with us, see our Intellectual Property Policy.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">5. EYouth Learning’s Rights to Content You Post
        </p>
        <p>
             You retain ownership of content you post to our platform, including your courses. We’re allowed to share your content to anyone through any media, including promoting it via advertising on other websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            The content you post as a student or instructor (including courses) remains yours. By posting courses and other content, you allow EYouth Learning to reuse and share it but you do not lose any ownership rights you may have over your content. If you are an instructor, be sure to understand the content licensing terms that are detailed in the Instructor Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you post content, comments, questions, reviews, and when you submit to us ideas and suggestions for new features or improvements, you authorize EYouth Learning to use and share this content with anyone, distribute it and promote it on any platform and in any media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit.
        </p>
        <p>
            In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the platforms, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute your content (including your name and image) in any and all media or distribution methods (existing now or later developed). This includes making your content available to other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with EYouth Learning for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication of content on other media, as well as using your content for marketing purposes. You also waive any rights of privacy, publicity, or other rights of a similar nature applicable to all these uses, to the extent permissible under applicable law. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power, and authority necessary to authorize us to use any content that you submit. You also agree to all such uses of your content with no compensation paid to you.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">6. Using EYouth Learning at Your Own Risk        </p>
        <p>
            Anyone can use EYouth Learning to create and publish content and instructors and we enable instructors and students to interact for teaching and learning. Like other platforms where people can post content and interact, some things can go wrong, and you use EYouth Learning at your own risk.
        </p>       
        <p>
            Our platform model means we do not review or edit the content for legal issues, and we are not in a position to determine the legality of content. We do not exercise any editorial control over the content that is available on the platform and, as such, do not guarantee in any manner the reliability, validity, accuracy, or truthfulness of the content. If you access content, you rely on any information provided by an instructor at your own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive, indecent, or objectionable. EYouth Learning has no responsibility to keep such content from you and no liability for your access or enrollment in any course or other content, to the extent permissible under applicable law. This also applies to any content relating to health, wellness, and physical exercise. You acknowledge the inherent risks and dangers in the strenuous nature of these types of content, and by accessing such content you choose to assume those risks voluntarily, including risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during, and after your access to the content.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you interact directly with a student or an instructor, you must be careful about the types of personal information that you share. While we restrict the types of information instructors may request from students, we do not control what students and instructors do with the information they obtain from other users on the platform. You should not share your email or other personal information about you for your safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not hire or employ instructors nor are we responsible or liable for any interactions involved between instructors and students. We are not liable for disputes, claims, losses, injuries, or damage of any kind that might arise out of or relate to the conduct of instructors or students.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you use our Services, you will find links to other websites that we don’t own or control. We are not responsible for the content or any other aspect of these third-party sites, including their collection of information about you. You should also read their terms and conditions and privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">7. EYouth Learning’s Rights
        </p>
        <p>
            We own EYouth Learning platform and Services, including the website, present or future apps and services, and things like our logos, API, code, and content created by our employees. You can’t tamper with those or use them without authorization.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">8. Subscription Terms</p>
        <p>
            This section covers additional terms that apply to your use of our subscription-based collections as a student (“Subscription Plans”). By using a Subscription Plan, you agree to the additional terms in this section. Note that use of EYouth Learning Business is not subject to these Terms, but is instead governed by the agreement between EYouth Learning and the subscribing organization.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">8.1 Subscription Plans        </p>
        <p>
            During your subscription to a Subscription Plan, you get a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license from us to access and view the content included in that Subscription Plan via the Services. With the exception of the lifetime access license grant, the terms included in the “Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access” section above apply to enrollments via Subscription Plans.
        </p>
        <p>
            The subscription that you purchase or renew determines the scope, features, and price of your access to a Subscription Plan. You may not transfer, assign, or share your subscription with anyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to revoke any license to use the content in our Subscription Plans for legal or policy reasons at any time and at our sole discretion, such as if we no longer have the right to offer the content through a Subscription Plan. Additional information on our right to revoke is included in the “Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access” section.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">8.2 Account Management
        </p>
        <p>
            You may cancel your subscription by following the steps outlined on our Support Page. If you cancel your subscription to a Subscription Plan, your access to that Subscription Plan will automatically end on the last day of your billing period. On cancellation, you will not be entitled to receive a refund or credit of any fees already paid for your subscription, unless otherwise required by applicable law. For clarity, cancellation of a subscription does not terminate your EYouth Learning account.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">8.3 Free Trials & Renewals
        </p>
        <p>
            Your subscription may start with a free trial. The duration of the free trial period of your subscription will be specified during sign-up. EYouth Learning determines free trial eligibility at our sole discretion and may limit eligibility or duration. We reserve the right to terminate the free trial and suspend your subscription if we determine that you aren’t eligible.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will charge the subscription fee for your next billing cycle at the end of the free trial period. Your subscription will automatically renew according to your subscription settings (e.g., monthly or annually) unless you cancel your subscription prior to the end of the free trial period. For more information on how to view applicable fees and dates of your free trial period, visit our Support Page.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">8.4 Payments and Billing
        </p>
        <p>
            The subscription fee will be listed at the time of your purchase. You can visit our Support Page to learn more about where to find the fees and dates applicable to your subscription. We may also be required to add taxes to your subscription fee as described in the “Payments, Credits, and Refunds” section above. Payments are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Depending on where you are located, you may qualify for a refund. See our Refund Policy for Subscription Plans for additional information.
        </p>
        <p>
            To subscribe to a Subscription Plan, you must provide a payment method. By subscribing to a Subscription Plan and providing your billing information during checkout, you grant us and our payment service providers the right to process payment for the then-applicable fees via the payment method we have on record for you. At the end of each subscription term, we will automatically renew your subscription for the same length of term and process your payment method for payment of the then-applicable fees.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event that we update your payment method using information provided by our payment service providers (as described in the “Payments, Credits, and Refunds” section above), you authorize us to continue to charge the then-applicable fees to your updated payment method.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we are unable to process payment through the payment method we have on file for you, or if you file a chargeback disputing charges made to your payment method and the chargeback is granted, we may suspend or terminate your subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to change our Subscription Plans or adjust pricing for our Services at our sole discretion. Any price changes or changes to your subscription will take effect following notice to you, except as otherwise required by applicable law.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">8.5 Subscription Disclaimers
        </p>
        <p>
            We make no guarantees as to the availability of any specific content in any Subscription Plan or as to any minimum amount of content in any Subscription Plan. At any point in the future, we reserve the right to offer or cease to offer additional features to any Subscription Plan, or to otherwise modify or terminate a Subscription Plan at our sole discretion. These disclaimers are in addition to those listed in the “Disclaimers” section below.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">9. Miscellaneous Legal Terms
        </p>
        <p>
            These Terms are like any other contract, and they have boring but important legal terms that protect us from the countless things that could happen and that clarify the legal relationship between us and you.

            If you are an instructor accepting these Terms and using our Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any version of these Terms in a language other than English is provided for convenience and you understand and agree that the English language will control if there is any conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Terms (including any agreements and policies linked from these Terms) constitute the entire agreement between you and us (which include, if you are an instructor, the Instructor Terms and the Promotions Policy).
        </p>
        <p>
            If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if we are delayed in exercising our rights or fail to exercise a right in one case, it doesn’t mean we waive our rights under these Terms, and we may decide to enforce them in the future. If we decide to waive any of our rights in a particular instance, it doesn’t mean we waive our rights generally or in the future.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">9.2 Disclaimers
        </p>
        <p>
            It may happen that our platform is down, either for planned maintenance or because something goes down with the site. It may happen that one of our instructors is making misleading statements in their content. It may also happen that we encounter security issues. These are just examples. You accept that you will not have any recourse against us in any of these types of cases where things don’t work out right. In legal, more complete language, the Services and their content are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no representations or warranties about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, security, lack of errors, or accuracy of the Services or their content, and expressly disclaim any warranties or conditions (express or implied), including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no warranty that you will obtain specific results from use of the Services. Your use of the Services (including any content) is entirely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may decide to cease making available certain features of the Services at any time and for any reason. Under no circumstances will EYouth Learning or its affiliates, suppliers, partners or agents be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of availability of such features.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are not responsible for delay or failure of our performance of any of the Services caused by events beyond our reasonable control, like an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; natural disaster; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage; or government restrictions.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">9.3 Limitation of Liability
        </p>
        <p>
            There are risks inherent to using our Services, for example, if you access health and wellness content like yoga, and you injure yourself. You fully accept these risks and you agree that you will have no recourse to seek damages against even if you suffer loss or damage from using our platform and Services. In legal, more complete language, to the extent permitted by law, we (and our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including loss of data, revenue, profits, or business opportunities, or personal injury or death), whether arising in contract, warranty, tort, product liability, or otherwise, and even if we’ve been advised of the possibility of damages in advance. Our liability (and the liability of each of our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) to you or any third parties under any circumstance is limited to the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or the amount you have paid us in the twelve (12) months before the event giving rise to your claims. Some jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so some of the above may not apply to you.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">9.4 Indemnification
        </p>
        <p>
            If you behave in a way that gets us in legal trouble, we may exercise legal recourse against you. You agree to indemnify, defend (if we so request), and hold harmless EYouth Learning, our group companies, and their officers, directors, suppliers, partners, and agents from an against any third-party claims, demands, losses, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from (a) the content you post or submit, (b) your use of the Services (c) your violation of these Terms, or (d) your violation of any rights of a third party. Your indemnification obligation will survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the Services.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">9.5 Governing Law and Jurisdiction
        </p>
        <p>
            When these Terms mention “EYouth Learning,” they’re referring to the EYouth Learning entity that you’re contracting with. If you’re a student, your contracting entity and governing law will generally be determined based on your location.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">9.6 Legal Actions and Notices
        </p>
        <p>
            No action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued, except where this limitation cannot be imposed by law.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given by registered or certified mail return receipt requested, or email (by us to the email associated with your account or by you to support@eyouthegypt.com).
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">9.7 Relationship Between Us
        </p>
        <p>
            You and we agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, contractor, or agency relationship exists between us.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">9.8 No Assignment
        </p>
        <p>
            You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted under them). For example, if you registered an account as an employee of a company, your account cannot be transferred to another employee. We may assign these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted under them) to another company or person without restriction. Nothing in these Terms confers any right, benefit, or remedy on any third-party person or entity. You agree that your account is non-transferable and that all rights to your account and other rights under these Terms terminate upon your death.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">10. Updating These Terms
        </p>
        <p>
            From time to time, we may update these Terms to clarify our practices or to reflect new or different practices (such as when we add new features), and EYouth Learning reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify and/or make changes to these Terms at any time. If we make any material change, we will notify you using prominent means, such as by email notice sent to the email address specified in your account or by posting a notice through our Services. Modifications will become effective on the day they are posted unless stated otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your continued use of our Services after changes become effective shall mean that you accept those changes. Any revised Terms shall supersede all previous Terms.
